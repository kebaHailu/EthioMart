## Entity Extraction for Amharic E-commerce Telegram Channels using LLM Fine-Tuning


This project focuses on building a real-time data ingestion and entity extraction pipeline for Amharic messages from Ethiopian e-commerce Telegram channels. The system leverages fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations. The extracted information is used to populate a centralized platform for EthioMart, aiming to streamline e-commerce activities in Ethiopia by consolidating decentralized Telegram channels into a unified hub. The project also includes handling Amharic-specific linguistic features and evaluating model performance for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
